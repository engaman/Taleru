Awesome experience! A must visit place, if you enjoy being amidst nature. Beautiful, scenic lake surrounded by hills all around and some eating stalls setup by local people along the entry road. This place is famous among tourists for boating. If you want some thrill and adventure then definitely opt for the motor boat ride. All in all it's a must visit place, a few kms away from Dalhousie...!!!!<hr>

Definitely a very beautiful lake reservoir of Chamera Dam.
Boat ride is the place where you are allowed to take photographs of the dam.
Place is having at least a dozen street food vendors and all are selling maggie noodles.
Didn't try food here.
I was here on 3rd December as well as on 8th December of 2018. Climate here is super cool in this season.
Greenish blue water makes you go blank and also the Snowy mountain tops of Himalayas visible from here are breathtaking.<hr>

It's wonderful to row  in a lake surrounded by hills. Two types of experiences are available, one with the speed boat and another with motor boat, both are good at their part. A must visit if you are at Dalhousie.<hr>

Chamera lake is very clean and a decent place for boating. The lake is maintained well. There were some broken wood piece those got collected near the dam looking like an island on the river. The boating experience was good. This is actually confluence of two rivers. The water was ice cold. Good place for spending half a day.<hr>
